# Accelearate out of the box.

HCL Accelerate is DevOps tool that gathers information across the release lifecycle frome different sources. By mapping the movement of tasks it can provide insight on important metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and bottlenecking across your team.

Accelerate suports multiple integrations: Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub, etc. This flexibility allows teams to customize their experience as they see fit. In {urbancode/velicity/accelerate} we understan that some of our clients are looking for an out of the box experience, this is why we have created this series of templates to help teams integrate accelerate the smothest way possible.

In this tutorial we will focus on a github only integration.

Thanks to the plethora of DevOps tools already in the market, we can levarage their information to give insights on the performance of our team, and lifecyle of our product.
